I wanted to run two sshd processes listening on different ports with different login setups. The only way to do this is to launch the regular sshd
daemon through init and then launch the second ssh process by hand when logging in.  You can't start two daemons from the same init script.  The
second problem is sshd uses the same /var/run/sshd.pid file every time it is started/stopped, so even if you start a second process by hand, it
whacks the existing pid file.  without a pidfile pointing to the correct sshd daemon, you cannot stop the process with the init script. 

This is an init script which makes provisions to launch a second sshd process, using an alternate sshd_config file (sshd_config.wan),
and attempts to manage the pid files re-creating them if needed.
